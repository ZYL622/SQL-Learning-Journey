This is the documentation of learning journey of 'VIEWS' 
=========================================================================

< Used Database >:  
    (1) SalesDB
        >> File Path: datasets/init-sqlserver-salesdb.sql

< Definitation >
    -  Virtual table based on the result set of a query, without storing data in database
    -> Views are persisted SQL queries in the database.

< VIEW vs TABLE >
            VIEW                                    TABLE
            No persistance                          Persisted Data
            Easy to Maintain & Change               Hard to Maintain & Change
            Slow response                           Fast response
            Read                                    Read / Write

< VIEW vs CTE >
            VIEW                                            CTE
            Reduce redundancy in multiple queries           Reduce redundancy in 1 query
            Improve reusability in multiple queries         Improve reusability in 1 query
            Persisted logic                                 Temporary Logic on thr fly
            Need to maintain (create/drop)                  No maintainance (auto cleanup)

< Use Case >
    (1) Sotre Central Complex Query Logic to be reused 
        - Store central, complex query logic in the database for access by multiple queries, 
            reducing project complexity
    (2) Hide Complexity
        - Views can be use to hide the complexity of database tables and 
            offer users more friendly and easy-to-consume object
    (3) Data Security
        - Use views to enforce security and protect sensitive data,
            by hiding columns or rows from tables
    (4) Flexibility & Dynamic
        - Users can have freedom to change column names & make changes
    (5) Multiple Languages
        - Provide customerized views to different clients
    (6) Virtual Data Marts in DWH
        - Views can be used as Data Marts in Data Warehouse System because they provide a flexible
            and efficient way to present data.
        {Data marts}: are specialized subsets of data warehouses that are focused on a specific business line, 
                        department, or functionâ€”such as sales, finance, or marketing.

< CREATE / UPDATE / DROP >

=================== Create View  =================== 

=== Codes ===
CREATE VIEW SchemaName.ViewName AS
(
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...
)


=================== Drop View  =================== 

=== Codes ===
DROP VIEW SchemaName.ViewName


=================== Update View  =================== 

First Drop, then Create it
=== Codes ===
IF OBJECT_ID ('SchemaName.ViewName', 'V') IS NOT NULL
    DROP VIEW SchemaName.ViewName;
GO
CREATE VIEW SchemaName.ViewName AS
(
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
