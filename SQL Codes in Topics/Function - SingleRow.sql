=========================================================================

< Used Database >:  
    (1) MyDatabase
        >> File Path: datasets/init-sqlserver-mydatabase.sql
    (2) SalesDB
        >> File Path: datasets/init-sqlserver-salesdb.sql

< Function >:
    A built-in SQL code: 
        (1) accepts an input value
        (2) process it
        (3) returns an output value

    >> Topic 1: Single-Row Functions    (Input is a single value)
        - String Functions
        - Number Functions
        - Date & Time Functions
        - NULL Functions
        - Case Functions

    >> Topic 2: Multi-Row Functions     (Inputs are multiple values)  
        - Aggregate
        - Window

< Note >:
    (1) Usually, the usage of Single-Row Functions is to prepare data for the Multi-Row Functions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

======================================================
=================  String Functions  =================
======================================================

>> Manipulation
    - CONCAT:   Combine multiple strings into one
        **[e.g]** CONCAT(col_name_1, '-', col_name_2)

    - UPPER:    Combine all characters to uppercase

    - LOWER:    Combine all characters to lowercase

    - TRIM:     Remove empty spaces at the start & end of strings

    - REPLACE:  Replace a specific character with a new character; 
                Also could be used to remove sth by replaced by ''
        **[e.g]** REPLACE(string, old_value, new_value)

>> Calculation
    - LEN:      Count how many characters

>> String Extraction
    - LEFT:     Extract specific number of characters from the Start
        **[e.g]** LEFT(value, nr_of_character)

    - RIGHT:    Extract specific number of characters from the End
        **[e.g]** RIGHT(value, nr_of_character)

    - SUBSTRING:Extract a part of string at a specified position
        **[e.g]** SUBSTRING(value, start_postion, length)
        ** Notion ** 
            (1) 'start_postion' counts from 1;
            (2) SUBSTRING(value, 3, 4) would get 3rd & 4th characters
            (3) Coule use LEN function to get variable length of substring



======================================================
=================  Number Functions  =================
======================================================

>> ROUND:   Round decimals & keep fixed number of digits
    **[e.g]** ROUND(value, nr_dicimals_to_left)
    **[e.g]** ROUND(3.516, 2)   >> 3.520
    **[e.g]** ROUND(3.516, 1)   >> 3.500
    **[e.g]** ROUND(3.516, 0)   >> 4.000

>> ABS:     Return the absolute value of a number
    **[e.g]** ABS(value)
    **[e.g]** ABS(-10)  >> -10
    **[e.g]** ABS(10)   >> 10



=============================================================
=================  Date and Time Functions  =================
=============================================================

>> 3 Types of data
    (1) DATE:       Year - Month - Day
    (2) TIME:       Hours - Minutes - Seconds
    (3) Datetime2 / Datetime:   DATE + TIME
    
    === Notion ===
        (1) Naming difference: In Oracle, Postgres, MySQL: it's called Timestamp; 
                                In SQL server: it's called DateTime
        (2) Difference between Datetime2 & Datetime:
            `DATETIME2` is a newer, more precise version of `DATETIME` in SQL Server. 
            It supports higher fractional seconds precision (up to 7 digits), 
            a wider date range (year 0001â€“9999), and uses storage more efficiently. 
            Use `DATETIME2` for better accuracy and future-proofing.

>> 3 Sources to query dates
    (1) Date column from a table
    (2) Hardcoded constant string value
    (3) From function: GETDATE()

>> 4 Types of Date Manupalation
    (1) Part Extraction
    (2) Format & Casting
    (3) Calculation
    (4) Validation

--------------------------------------------------------

>> GETDATE():     Returns current 'Date & Time' at the momnent when the quary is executed

>> Part Extraction
    - DAY:      Return the Day(INT) from a date
    - MONTH:    Return the Month(INT) from a date
    - YEAR:     Return the Year(INT) from a date
        **[e.g]** YEAR(date), MONTH(date), DAY(date)

    - DATEPART: Return a specific part of a date as a number(INT) (e.g., week, quarter)
        **[e.g]** DATEPART(desired_part, given_date)
        **[e.g]** desired_part: 
            year, month / mm, day, hour, quarter, weekday, week

    - DATENAME: Return the Name of a specific part of a date (String)
        **[e.g]**   DATENAME(desired_part, given_date)
        **[e.g]**   desired_part: month, weekday; quarter, day, week
        ** Notion ** 
            (1) year, day, quarter, and week can also be used in DATENAME, however, the data type would be String

    - DATETRUNC:Keep the date to the specific part & reset the following part as 0
                i.e., Drop the too detailed information (from high-level to low-level)
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC(desired_part, given_date)
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC('2025-08-20 18:55:45', minute)  >> '2025-08-20 18:55:00'
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC('2025-08-20 18:55:45', hour)    >> '2025-08-20 18:00:00'
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC('2025-08-20 18:55:45', day)     >> '2025-08-20 00:00:00'
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC('2025-08-20 18:55:45', month)   >> '2025-08-01 00:00:00'
        **[e.g]**   DATETRUNC('2025-08-20 18:55:45', year)    >> '2025-01-01 00:00:00'
        ** Why it's useful ? **
            Can group by the rows quickly based on any level 

    - EOMONTH:  Return the end day of the month (output data type: DATE)
        **[e.g]** EOMONTH(given_date)
        **[e.g]** EOMONTH('2025-02-01') >> '2025-02-28'
        **[e.g]** EOMONTH('2025-03-31') >> '2025-03-31'
    
    === Notion ===
        (1) The outputs of following Functions are INT:
            YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DATEPART
        (2) The outputs of following Functions are STRING:
            DATENAME
        (3) The outputs of following Functions are DATETIME:
            DATETRUNC
        (4) The outputs of following Functions are DATE:
            EOMONTH


>> Format & Casting

    - FORMAT:   Format a date or time value (change how data looks)
        **[e.g]** FORMAT(value, format [, culture])
        **[e.g]** FORMAT(given_date, 'dd/MM/yyyy')
        **[e.g]** FORMAT('2025-01-10', 'dd')    >> 10
        **[e.g]** FORMAT('2025-01-10', 'ddd')   >> Fri
        **[e.g]** FORMAT('2025-01-10', 'dddd')  >> Friday
        **[e.g]** FORMAT('2025-01-10', 'yy')    >> 25
        **[e.g]** FORMAT('2025-08-20 18:55:45', 'tt')   >> PM

    - CONVERT: Convert a date or time value to a different data type & Format the value by [,style]
        **[e.g]** CONVERT(data_type, value [,style])
        **[e.g]** CONVERT(INT, '124')
        **[e.g]** CONVERT(VARCHAR, given_date, 32) AS [USA Std.]
        **[e.g]** CONVERT(VARCHAR, given_date, 34) AS [EURO Std.]
        **[e.g]** CONVERT(VARCHAR, given_date, 23) AS [International Std.]

    - CAST:  Change the data type 
        **[e.g]**  CAST(value AS data_type)
        **[e.g]**  CAST('123' AS INT)
        **[e.g]**  CAST('2025-08-20' AS DATE)

    === Notion ===  
        (1) Date Time Format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
            Adopted from International Standard (ISO 8601)
            There are other standards: USA: [MM-dd-yyyy]; European: [dd-MM-yyyy]

        (2) Default setting of optional parameters
            -> default of [, culture]:  'en-US'
            -> default of [,style]:     0

        (3) The data type of the output of FORMAT can only be String
    
    === Usage Summary ===
        Casting:    CAST & CONVERT: Any type to Any type
                    FORMAT:         Any type to only string
        Formating:  CAST:           Cannot
                    CONVERT:        Only Date + Time
                    FORMAT:         Both Date + Time & Numbers

>> Calculation
    - DATEADD:  Add or Substract a specific time interval to/from a date
        **[e.g]**   DATEADD(part_to_change, interval, date)
        **[e.g]**   DATEADD(year, 2, '2025-08-01')      >> '2027-08-01'
        **[e.g]**   DATEADD(month, -4, '2025-08-01')    >> '2025-04-01'
        **[e.g]**   DATEADD(day, 1, '2025-08-01')    >> '2025-08-02'

    - DATEDIFF: Find difference between 2 dates
        **[e.g]**   DATEDIFF(part_focused, start_date, end_date)
        **[e.g]**   DATEDIFF(year, '2025-08-20', '2026-02-01')  >> 1
        **[e.g]**   DATEDIFF(month, '2025-08-20', '2026-02-01') >> 6

>> Validation
    - ISDATE:   Check if a value is a date (International Standard Format OR Year)
                Return 1 for Yes & 0 for No
        **[e.g]**   ISDATE(value)
        **[e.g]**   ISDATE('2025-08-20')    >> 1
        **[e.g]**   ISDATE('20-08-2025')    >> 0
        **[e.g]**   ISDATE('2025')          >> 1
        **[e.g]**   ISDATE('08')            >> 0
            


====================================================
=================  NULL Functions  =================
====================================================

>> Insert data into NULL
    - ISNULL:   Replace 'NULL' with a specificed value
        **[e.g]**   ISNULL(value_to_check, value_to_replace_NULLs)
        **[e.g]**   ISNULL(ShippingAddress, 'N/A')
        **[e.g]**   ISNULL(ShippingAddress, BillingAddress)

    - COALESCE: Return the first non-null value from a list
        **[e.g]**   COALESCE(value_1, value_2, value_3, ...)

    === Notion ===
        (1) Naming Difference:
            ISNULL -> SQL Server; NVL -> Oracle; IFNULL -> MySQL
            However, COALESCE is same for all SQL languages
        (2) Running Speed differece: ISNULL is faster than COALESCE
        (3) Suggestions: If COALESCE won't lead to much worse performance, 
                        using COALESCE can keep codes consistent
    
    === Usage ===
        (1) Handle NULL before doing data aggregations
            - Use NULL or other specific value could affect the results of following functions: 
                AVG(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(col_name)
                ** Note: Won't affect CONUT(*) as it consider rows instead of values

        (2) Handle NULL before doing mathmatical operations
            - NULL + 5      => NULL
            - NULL + 'B'    => NULL

        (3) Handle NULL before doing JOINS
            - What if NULLs are inside keys?
                Then Equal operator cannot able to join tables in case of NULL
                Thus, lose more information.
            - So, how to handle NULL insides keys?
                ISNULL(table_name_1.col_name_1, '') = ISNULL(table_name_2.col_name_2, '')

        (4) Handle NULL before sorting data
            - NULL will be regarded as lowest value in default


>> Replace data with NULL

    - NULLIF:   Compare two expressions, returns
        (1) If they are equal       >>  NULL, 
        (2) if they are not equal   >>  First value
        **[e.g]**   NULLIF(value_1, value_2)
        **[e.g]**   NULLIF(Price, -1)

    === Usage ===
        (1) Prevent the error of dividing by 0


>> Check whether it's NULL or not

    - IS NULL:      Return TRUE if the value is NULL; otherwise, FALSE
        **[e.g]**   value IS NULL

    - IS NOT NULL:  Return TRUE if the value is not NULL; otherwise, FALSE
        **[e.g]**   value IS NOT NULL
    
    === Usage ===
        (1) Filter data that have missing info OR non-missing info
        (2) Do right/left anti JOIN: find the unmatched rows between two tables
            LEFT ANTI JOIN: All rows from the left table without matches in the right


** Notion **
    (1) Difference between NULL, Empty string, Blank spaces
                                NULL                Empty string                Blank spaces
        Representation      NULL                    ''                          ' '
        Meaning             Unknown                 Known, Empty value          Known, it's space value
        Data Type           Special Marker          String (with size 0)        String (with size >=1)
        Storage             Very minimal            use memory                  use memory for each space
        Peformance          Best                    Fast                        Slow
        Comparison          IS NULL                 = ''                        = ' '
        DATALENGTH()        NULL                    0                           >= 1
    
    (2) Use Data Policy to bring standards

        Policy 1: Trim the blank spaces in the begining & end
        Policy 2: Replace empty strings & blanks with NULL
        Policy 3: Use the default value 'unknown' for all NULLs, empty strings, and blank spaces

        Advantages of Policy 2: Druing data preparation in ETL, Optimize storages & performance
        Advantages of Policy 3: If it would be used just before reporting, it could improve readibility & reduce confusion 



====================================================
=================  Case Functions  =================

Policy 1: Trim the blank spaces in the begining & end
Policy 2: Replace empty strings & blanks with NULL
Policy 3: Use the default value 'unknown' for all NULLs, empty strings, and blank spaces

Advantages of Policy 2: Druing data preparation in ETL, Optimize storages & performance
Advantages of Policy 3: If it would be used just before reporting, it could improve readibility & reduce confusion
